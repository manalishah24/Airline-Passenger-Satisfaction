#Airline Passenger Satisfaction
This repository contains the implementation of a Customer Satisfaction Prediction project using classification methods. The project aims to predict customer satisfaction among airline passengers and identify key factors influencing their satisfaction rating.

**Methods:**
Data Preprocessing and Visualization: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers. Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps are employed to analyze data distribution and identify important features.
Classification Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests - are implemented to predict passenger satisfaction. Evaluation methods such as Confusion Matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure accuracy.

**Results and Findings:**
The classification models achieve high accuracy in predicting customer satisfaction.
Important features such as flight distance, online boarding, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, on-board service, leg-room service, and cleanliness are identified as key factors influencing passenger satisfaction.

**Conclusion:**
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of classification methods in predicting customer satisfaction on a large dataset. The identified key features provide valuable insights for airlines to prioritize investments in enhancing customer experience.
